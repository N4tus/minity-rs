# minity-rs
This is a rebuild of the framework I was using during a cg course. The original was called `minity` and implemented in C++ with OpenGL
and ImGui, so I chose to rewrite it in Rust, using wgpu and egui. I am planning to split the backend into its own crate to reuse it for other personal objects.  

This project is purely for fun end education and not for any practical use.
